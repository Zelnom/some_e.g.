# 1. Write a program that will display on the screen whether the value of the variable is divisible by 7

# input1 = int(input("Please, insert a number: "))
# print(f"The number introduced is: {input1}")
# if input1 % 7 == 0:
#     print(f"The number {input1} that you choose is divisible by 7")
# else:
#     print(f"The number {input1} that you chose is not divisible by 7")
#     print("Try again!")
# print("Thank you!")

# 2. Write a program that will display the text “The value of the variable is odd” on the screen if the
# value of the variable is odd, and otherwise display the text “The specified value is even”.

# variable1 = int(input("May you insert a value: "))
# print(f"The value inserted is: {variable1}")
# if variable1 % 2 == 1:
#     print("The value of the variable is odd")
# else:
#     print("the specified value is even")
# print("The process has been completed")

# 3. Write a program that will display on the screen whether the variable value is divisible by 7, by 5 or by 3.
# If the variable value is not divisible by any of these numbers, the program should display an appropriate message.

# variable_inserted = int(input("Please, put a variable: "))
# print(f"The variable that you selected is: {variable_inserted}")
# if variable_inserted % 7 == 0:
#     print(f"The variable {variable_inserted} is divisible by 7")
# elif variable_inserted % 5 == 0:
#     print(f"The variable {variable_inserted} is divisible by 5")
# elif variable_inserted % 3 == 0:
#     print(f"The variable {variable_inserted} is divisible by 3")
# else:
#     print("The variable selected is not divisible by 7,5 or 3")

# 4. Write a program that will display the following results for the specified variable:
# ◦ the difference between the value of this variable and 17 if the difference is less than 17
# ◦ o the square of this difference, otherwise

# varia = int(input("The variable specified is: "))
# if varia < 34:
#     diff = varia - 17
#     print(f"The difference between the value is {diff}")
# else:
#     diff = varia - 17
#     # print(f"The difference is > 17 =>{0 ** diff}")
#     print(f"The difference is > 17, so we get: {diff ** 2}")

# 5. Write a program that returns the sum of the three numbers given.
# If all three numbers are equal, the program will return the triple value of their sum..

# a = int(input("The first number is: "))
# # print(f"The first number is: {a}")
# b = int(input("The second number is: "))
# # print(f"The second number is: {b}")
# c = int(input("The third number is: "))
# # print(f"The third number is: {c}")
# sum = a + b + c
# if a == b == c:
#     print(f"The sum of the numbers is {sum*3}")
# else:
#     print(f"The sum of the numbers is: {sum}")
