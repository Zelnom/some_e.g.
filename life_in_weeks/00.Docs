Task:
-to create a program using maths and f-string that will tell us how many weeks we have left until the age of 90


-usually a year has 52 weeks, however every four years there is one extra day to the 52 weeks

After trying different values I saw that in case we give a wrong input it returns an error, so I made the version
    upgrade to return a custom error as to understand better what is wrong with the input
